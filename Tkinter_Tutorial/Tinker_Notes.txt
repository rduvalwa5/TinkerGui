Tkinter Programming
Tkinter is the standard GUI library for Python. Python when combined with Tkinter provides a fast and easy way 
to create GUI applications. Tkinter provides a powerful object-oriented interface to the Tk GUI toolkit.

Creating a GUI application using Tkinter is an easy task. All you need to do is perform the following steps −

	- Import the Tkinter module.
	- Create the GUI application main window.
	- Add one or more of the above-mentioned widgets to the GUI application.
	- Enter the main event loop to take action against each event triggered by the user.

Example
	#!/usr/bin/python

	import tkinter
	top = tkinter.Tk()
	# Code to add widgets will go here...
	top.mainloop()

Tkinter Widgets
	There are currently 15 types of widgets in Tkinter. We present these widgets as well as a brief description 
	in the following table −

	Operator		Description
	Button			The Button widget is used to display buttons in your application.
	Canvas			The Canvas widget is used to draw shapes, such as lines, ovals, polygons and rectangles, 
					in your application.
	Checkbutton		The Checkbutton widget is used to display a number of options as checkboxes. 
					The user can select multiple options at a time.
	Entry			The Entry widget is used to display a single-line text field for accepting values 
					from a user.
	Frame			The Frame widget is used as a container widget to organize other widgets.
	Label			The Label widget is used to provide a single-line caption for other widgets. 
					It can also contain images.
	Listbox			The Listbox widget is used to provide a list of options to a user.

Geometry Management
	All Tkinter widgets have access to specific geometry management methods, which have the purpose of 
	organizing widgets throughout the parent widget area. Tkinter exposes the following geometry manager 
	classes: pack, grid, and place.

	The pack() Method - This geometry manager organizes widgets in blocks before placing 
						them in the parent widget.
						https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/tk_pack.htm

	The grid() Method - This geometry manager organizes widgets in a table-like structure in the 
						parent widget.
						https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/tk_grid.htm

	The place() Method -This geometry manager organizes widgets by placing them in a specific 
						position in the parent widget.

	You can attach a function or a method to a button which is called automatically 
	when you click the button.
		
	Syntax
	Here is the simple syntax to create this widget −

		w = Button ( master, option=value, ... )

	Parameters
	master: 	This represents the parent window.
	options: 	Here is the list of most commonly used options for this widget. 
				These options can be used as key-value pairs separated by commas.

	Option				Description
	activebackground	Background color when the button is under the cursor.
	activeforeground	Foreground color when the button is under the cursor.
	bd					Border width in pixels. Default is 2.
	bg					Normal background color.

	highlightcolor		The color of the focus highlight when the widget has focus.
	image				Image to be displayed on the button (instead of text).
	justify				How to show multiple text lines: LEFT to left-justify each line; 
						CENTER to center them; or RIGHT to right-justify.
	padx				Additional padding left and right of the text.
	pady				Additional padding above and below the text.
	relief				Relief specifies the type of the border. Some of the values are SUNKEN, 
						RAISED, GROOVE, and RIDGE.
	state				Set this option to DISABLED to gray out the button and make it unresponsive. 
						Has the value ACTIVE when the mouse is over it. Default is NORMAL.
	underline			Default is -1, meaning that no character of the text on the button will be 
						underlined. If nonnegative, the corresponding text character will be underlined.
	width				Width of the button in letters (if displaying text) or pixels (if displaying an 
						image).
	wraplength			If this value is set to a positive number, the text lines will be wrapped to fit 
						within this length.

	Methods		Following are commonly used methods for this widget −
	Method			Description
	flash()		Causes the button to flash several times between active and normal colors. 
				Leaves the button in the state it was in originally. Ignored if the button is disabled.

						units, such as when the user clicks on the arrows at the ends of a scrollbar.
	xscrollcommand		If the canvas is scrollable, this attribute should be the .set() method of 
						the horizontal scrollbar.
	yscrollincrement	Works like xscrollincrement, but governs vertical movement.
	yscrollcommand		If the canvas is scrollable, this attribute should be the .set() method of the vertical scrollbar.

	The Canvas widget can support the following standard items:
	arc 		Creates an arc item, which can be a chord, a pieslice or a simple arc.
	
		coord = 10, 50, 240, 210
		arc = canvas.create_arc(coord, start=0, extent=150, fill="blue")

	image				To display a graphic image on the button.
	justify				If the text contains multiple lines, this option controls how the text is 
						justified: CENTER, LEFT, or RIGHT.
	offvalue			Normally, a checkbutton's associated control variable will be set to 0 when 
						it is cleared (off). You can supply an alternate value for the off state by 
						setting offvalue to that value.
	onvalue				Normally, a checkbutton's associated control variable will be set to 1 when 
						it is set (on). You can supply an alternate value for the on state by setting
						onvalue to that value.
	padx				How much space to leave to the left and right of the checkbutton and text. 
						Default is 1 pixel.
	pady				How much space to leave above and below the checkbutton and text.

	state				The default is state=NORMAL, but you can use state=DISABLED to gray out the control and make it unresponsive. If the cursor is currently over the checkbutton, the state is ACTIVE.
	text				The label displayed next to the checkbutton. Use newlines ("\n") to display multiple lines of text.
	underline			With the default value of -1, none of the characters of the text label are underlined. Set this option to the index of a character in the text (counting from zero) to underline that character.
	variable			The control variable that tracks the current state of the checkbutton. Normally this variable is an IntVar, and 0 means cleared and 1 means set, but see the offvalue and onvalue options above.
	width				The default width of a checkbutton is determined by the size of the displayed 
						image or text. You can set this option to a number of characters and the checkbutton 
						will always have room for that many characters.
	wraplength			Normally, lines are not wrapped. You can set this option to a number of characters 
						and all lines will be broken into pieces no longer than that number.
