Python 2: Getting More Out of Python
 Lesson 11, Project 1

Here are your instructions:

Modify the classFactory.py source code so that the DataRow class returned by the build_row function has another method:

    retrieve(self, curs, condition=None)

self is (as usual) the instance whose method is being called, 
curs is a database cursor on an existing database connection, and condition (if present) is a string of condition(s)
which must be true of all received rows.

The retrieve method should be a generator, yielding successive rows of the result set until it is completely exhausted. 
Each row should be a next object of type DataRow.
