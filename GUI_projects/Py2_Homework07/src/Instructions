Python 2: Getting More Out of Python
 Lesson 7, Project 1

Here are your instructions:

Write a GUI-based program that provides two Entry fields, a button and a label. When the button is clicked, the value of each 
Entry should (if possible) be converted into a float. 
If both conversions succeed, the label should change to the sum of the two numbers. Otherwise it should read "***ERROR***".
